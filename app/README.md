The app module is the main entry point to the application. It depends on both the `dependencies` and `ui` modules.

**Responsibilities:**

* Initializes the application.
* Provides a container for the application's components.
* Coordinates communication between the `ui` and `dependencies` modules.

**Dependencies:**

* `dependencies`: Provides the necessary implementations for the application's features.
* `ui`: Provides the user interface for the application.
